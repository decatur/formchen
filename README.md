Generate HTML forms and two-way-binding of hierarchical and tabular/grid data with the help of [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).

Formchen (little form) supports undo/redo transaction management.

Edits on the original object are emitted as standard [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902),
which can be directly passed to the back end.

Formchen is written in plain EcmaScript 2017 modules and can be directly imported as such with any modern browser.
